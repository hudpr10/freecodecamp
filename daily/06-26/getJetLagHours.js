/*
Jet Lagged

Given a departure city, an arrival city, a flight duration in hours, and a direction of travel, return the number of jet lag hours the traveller is experiencing.

The given cities will be from the following list that includes their UTC offset:

To calculate jet lag hours:
  - Find the timezone difference in hours between the two cities.
  - Determine the direction multiplier. If travelling "east", it's 1.5, otherwise, it's 1.0.
  - Get the jet lag hours with the formula: timezone difference + (flight duration * 0.1) * direction multiplier

Return the jet lag hours rounded to one decimal place.
